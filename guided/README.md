# Guided TDD Implementation

This directory contains the results of the same shopping cart experiment, but with enhanced CLAUDE.md instructions that include:

- **Development methodology** guidance emphasizing business behavior and emergent design
- **Testing guidelines** for writing business-focused tests and using test data factories
- **TDD mindset** instructions explicitly describing the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Code smell identification** to prompt active refactoring
- **Design emergence** principles to encourage discovering abstractions through tests

The enhanced instructions aimed to bridge the gap between mechanically following TDD rules and developing with a true TDD mindset that actively improves design during the refactor phase.
